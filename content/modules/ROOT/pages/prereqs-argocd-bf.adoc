= Configuration, Installation, and Use of Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift

== Access Your Lab Environment

During this lab you will be instructed to ssh to your hypervisor at IP address {bastion_public_hostname}.
Use username `{bastion_ssh_user_name}` and password `{bastion_ssh_password}`.

Once logged in the hypervisor you can access to the bastion at IP address `192.168.123.100` as `root` using password `redhat`.

If needed, you can navigate to the OpenShift console URL: {ocp_console_url}[{ocp_console_url}^] using user `admin` and password `{ocp_admin_password}`

== Prerequisites for Installation

Some prerequisites needed to install Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift (RHOSO) are already included in the lab environment such as:

* An operational OpenShift cluster which supports Multus CNI
* oc command line tool on your workstation (bastion host)
* k9s command line tool on your workstation (bastion host)
* podman command line tool on your workstation (bastion host)
* Access to repositories which contain the Dev Preview code
* Access to an existing registry or create a local Quay registry
* Example YAML files are available in this repository which can be cloned or copy and pasted for use.
For ease of instructions it will be assumed the repo has been cloned

=== Install the Prerequisite Operators

There are three operators that are required to be installed before you can install the OpenStack Operator, the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/networking/kubernetes-nmstate#installing-the-kubernetes-nmstate-operator-cli[NMState  Operator^] the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/networking/load-balancing-with-metallb#nw-metallb-installing-operator-cli_metallb-operator-install[MetalLB  Operator^]  and the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14///security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-operator-install.html[Cert-Manager + Operator^]

==== Accessing the Cluster

From the hypervisor, log in to the bastion

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
sudo -i
ssh root@192.168.123.100
----

Password is `redhat`.

.Sample Output
----
[root@ocp4-bastion ~]
----

Make sure you can reach out to the OpenShift cluster, for instance, by listing the nodes in your cluster:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get nodes
----

.Sample Output
----
NAME                           STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION

----

==== Install Argocd

Create the *argocd* Operator namespace:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
    name: openshift-gitops-operator
    labels:
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged
      security.openshift.io/scc.podSecurityLabelSync: "false"
EOF
----

Create the *OperatorGroup*:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  generateName: openshift-gitops-operator-
  name: openshift-gitops-operator-b8wcv
  namespace: openshift-gitops-operator
spec:
  upgradeStrategy: Default
EOF
----

Confirm the OperatorGroup is installed in the namespace:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get operatorgroup -n openshift-gitops-operator
----

Subscribe to the *argocd* Operator:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  generation: 1
  labels:
    operators.coreos.com/openshift-gitops-operator.openshift-gitops-operator: ""
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  namespace: openshift-gitops-operator
spec:
  channel: latest
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  startingCSV: openshift-gitops-operator.v1.12.0
EOF
----

Confirm that argocd operator is running.
Execute the following command until you see the Phase Field is succeeded (Press Control+C to exit the command):

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get clusterserviceversion -n openshift-gitops-operator  -o custom-columns=Name:.metadata.name,Phase:.status.phase -w
----

Give the ServiceAccount for ArgoCD the ability to manage the cluster:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin -z openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller -n openshift-gitops
----
Connecting to OpenShift Gitops
OpenShift Gitops generates a default admin user, and a random password when first deployed.

Extract the password from the admin user Secret:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
argoPass=$(oc get secret/openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='{.data.admin\.password}' | base64 -d)
echo $argoPass
----

Get the Route for the OpenShift Gitops/OpenShift GitOps server:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
argoURL=$(oc get route openshift-gitops-server -n openshift-gitops -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}')
echo $argoURL
----

Access the OpenShift Gitops console by logging in with the username admin and the password extracted in the previous step.

== Fork the lab repo

Fork the github repo https://github.com/pnavarro/showroom_osp-on-ocp-break-fix-using-gitops into your github personal space. 

In the next chapter we will refer to this repo as the variable: $YOUR_REPO_URL

Example:

Replace $YOUR_REPO_URL by 'https://github.com/$your_github_id/showroom_osp-on-ocp-lb1374.git'

Clone your your own forked repo in the bastion:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
git clone $YOUR_REPO_URL labrepo
cd labrepo
----
